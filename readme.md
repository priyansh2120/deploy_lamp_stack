# Stack Configuration Scripts

This repository contains scripts for configuring two different stacks: LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) and MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). These scripts automate the deployment process for each stack and provide a foundation for building web applications.

## LAMP Stack Configuration Script

The LAMP stack configuration script (`lamp-stack-config.sh`) is used to deploy a simple ecommerce application built using PHP and MySQL. It performs the following steps:

1. Installs and configures firewalld.
2. Installs and configures the MySQL database.
3. Adds firewall rules for the database.
4. Creates the necessary database and user.
5. Loads inventory data into the database.
6. Installs Apache web server and PHP.
7. Adds firewall rules for the web server.
8. Updates the Apache configuration file to use index.php as the default page.
9. Starts and enables the Apache web server service.
10. Installs Git.
11. Downloads the ecommerce application code from Git.
12. Replaces the database IP address with localhost in the index.php file.
13. Checks if the web server is running and if the required items are present on the webpage.

### Usage

To use the LAMP stack configuration script:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/example/repository.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the cloned repository:

   ```bash
   cd repository
   ```

3. Run the LAMP stack configuration script:

   ```bash
   bash lamp-stack-config.sh
   ```

## MERN Stack Configuration Script

The MERN stack configuration script (`mern-stack-config.sh`) is used to deploy a sample application built using MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. It performs the following steps:

1. Installs and configures MongoDB.
2. Configures firewall rules for MongoDB.
3. Installs Node.js and npm.
4. Clones the MERN stack application code from the specified Git repository.
5. Installs project dependencies for both the client (React frontend) and the server (Express.js backend).
6. Builds the React frontend and moves the build folder to the server directory.
7. Starts the Node.js server.
8. Installs and configures Nginx as a reverse proxy.
9. Configures Nginx to serve the React app and proxy requests to the backend API.

### Usage

To use the MERN stack configuration script:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/example/repository.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the cloned repository:

   ```bash
   cd repository
   ```

3. Run the MERN stack configuration script:

   ```bash
   bash mern-stack-config.sh
   ```
